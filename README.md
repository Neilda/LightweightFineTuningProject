# LightweightFineTuningProject

This project is part of the Udacity Generative AI course, Generative AI Fundamentals module. To pass the project, my code needs to do the following:

1. Load a pre-trained model and evaluate its performance
2. Perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning using the pre-trained model
3. Perform inference using the fine-tuned model and compare its performance to the original model
